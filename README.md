# My Personal Blog

I have chosen to use [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) for this project after first seeing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I).
I'm using the [m10c theme](https://github.com/vaga/hugo-theme-m10c).


I had a similar system in place previously before where I write in markdown and it's rendered nicely, however it was extremely sluggish, took forever to build and wasn't enjoyable to work with for adding new features.

Another reason I opted for Hugo is because I'm trying to better my GO knowledge, although this doesn't require much GO work, it's still a nice project to have under my belt :).
