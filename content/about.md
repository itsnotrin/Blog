I take interest in a lot of things such as:
- Programming
- Virtualisation
- Self Hosting
- Privacy

This blog is the home to a lot of my thoughts regarding these topics in particular but I'll probably also drift off quite often too.

### Other info:

There are analytics on this site but obviously not Google Analytics. I self host [Plausible](https://plausible.io) for this. For transparency's sake, you can see the data [here](https://analytics.ryanwiecz.co.uk/blog.ryanwiecz.co.uk/)

Thank you for stopping by :3
